## You can always count on me when
Of course, if I can help on the technical side, I would be more than happy to do it.
But I think I'm a good listener and will gladly calm a person who's feeling down.
I don't like conflicts, neather, so it's always in that matter that I try making
everybody comfortable or safe.

## A funny story
When I was exploring for the first time my teenager's years, I did let grow my hair because
I wanted to look like some of my favorite artists (or at least, thought I will look alike)...
Anyway, some months later, feeling all shining like Jim Morrison, I returned at my home after school finished.
As I went past the entrance door, my mother said something like "Shall you not cut your hair ?
You actually look like Julien Clerc when he was younger." 

### TL;DR
Oh well... dreams come and go (as mine was heavily crushed)!
